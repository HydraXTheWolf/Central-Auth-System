The HTTP method is designed for using the API across file systems, however for security it is disabled by default.

You can enable it by changing the following line in 'config.php': "$allow_html_requests = false;" to "$allow_html_requests = true;"

All HTTP requests are to be sent to the index.php, as any HTTP requests to the api.php will be ignored

Every request requires 2 GET fields:
	key: every HTTP request requires your API key under the value 'key'
	type: this is the function name, the same as shown in the methods docs file.
	
Most of the methods also require some POST data, this is shown in the methods docs file.

An example of a listusers request(no post data for listusers) is:
"http://localhost/cas/?key=MYAPIKEY&type=listusers"
