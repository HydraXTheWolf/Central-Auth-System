Accessing this via the include method is recommended,
however it requires that the CAS is on the same file system as the service accessing it.

To use the API using this method, you need to first include the api.php, then create an API object with your API key.

-------------------------------------
require('cas/api.php');
$api = new CAS_API('your key here');
-------------------------------------

Once you have your API object, you can call any of the methods listed in 'docs/methods/'
